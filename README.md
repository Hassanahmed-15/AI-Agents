This repo is just for my own **practice and experiments with n8n workflows**.  
Iâ€™m using it to try out automations, agents, and AI tools â€” nothing too serious, just learning and building.

## ðŸ¤– Agent No. 1 â€“ Chatbot from Google Drive Files

**Agent 1** does a simple but cool job:

- Whenever I add a new file to a specific **Google Drive folder**,  
- It gets the fileâ€™s content and sends it to **Pinecone** (a vector database)  
- Uses **OpenAI embeddings** to understand the content  
- Then powers a **chatbot** that can answer questions about that document

Itâ€™s like turning my Google Drive files into something I can actually talk to.

More agents and experiments coming soon (hopefully).
